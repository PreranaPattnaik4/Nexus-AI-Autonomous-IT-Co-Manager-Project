                <li>
                    <strong>Do not rely on the AI for critical decisions.</strong> Do not make professional, legal, medical, financial, or safety-critical decisions based solely on its results. Use it to inform your work, then validate with qualified human experts.

            <p>Nexus AI is designed to be your autonomous IT co-manager. Hereâ€™s the primary workflow to get the most out of it:</p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Submit a Goal:</strong> Navigate to the <a href="/dashboard" className="text-primary hover:underline">Dashboard</a> and use the "Goal-Based Task Management" form. Describe a high-level objective in plain English (e.g., "Deploy the new marketing site").
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Let the AI Plan:</strong> Nexus AI's Planner Agent will analyze your goal and break it down into a series of actionable, technical steps. A new task will be created and appear in the "Recent Tasks" list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Monitor Execution:</strong> Watch the task's progress in real-time on the dashboard or in the tasks list. You can click "Details" to see the status of each individual step and any logs from the (simulated) execution.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Handle Issues Autonomously:</strong> If an alert appears on the dashboard (e.g., "High CPU"), use the "Resolve with AI" button to have Nexus autonomously create and execute a new task to fix it. If a task fails, use the "Retry with AI" button to let the agent analyze the failure and attempt a new, corrected plan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Review Reports:</strong> For any completed or failed task, you can view the AI-generated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) report to get a detailed understanding of what happened, why it happened, and how it was resolved.
                </li>
